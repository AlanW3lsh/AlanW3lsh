Hi, I'm Alan :wave:

I am an aspiring Salesforce Developer, originally from the city of Bath in the UK and now residing north of Wellington, New Zealand.

I'm always on the look out for any recommendations on all things Salesforce; be that integrations you can't live without since finding, or apex tips and tricks.
